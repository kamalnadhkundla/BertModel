Item 12
Territory

McDonald’s franchises contain a limited grant of authority to use the McDonald’s System in the
operation of the specific restaurant developed by McDonald’s at that address.  The Franchise Agreement does not
contain any exclusive grant, exclusive area, exclusive territorial rights, protected territory, or any right to exclude,
control, or impose conditions on the location or development of future McDonald’s restaurants at any time.  You
will not receive an exclusive territory.  You may face competition from other franchisees, from outlets that we
own, or from other channels of distribution or competitive brands that we control.  The sales and customer trading
patterns which a restaurant experiences at any particular time are subject to change by reason of many factors,
including our ongoing development of the marketing network of McDonald’s restaurant locations, and do not
represent any continuing franchisee entitlement or expectation.  McDonald’s may establish other franchisee or
McOpCo company-owned outlets that may alter customer trading patterns and affect the sales of, and compete
with, your location.  McDonald’s reserves the right to use the Marks (as described in Item 13) in any other
channel of distribution.  For example, McCafe packaged coffee is being sold in supermarkets and other retail
outlets and via e-commerce.  McDonald’s reserves the right to sell other similar goods and services under the
Marks or under different trademarks and service marks.  Internal policies which McDonald’s may apply and
modify periodically in connection with decisions to develop new restaurants are not part of the Franchise
Agreement and do not involve any contract right granted to you.
