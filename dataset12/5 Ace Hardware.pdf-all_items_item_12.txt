ITEM 12
TERRITORY
You will not receive an exclusive territory.  You may face competition from other member stores, from
stores that our affiliates own, competitive brands, and/or from other channels of distribution (for example,
the internet and mail order houses). We make sales directly to consumers on our website and mobile app.
We allocate online and mobile sales to member stores based on the store that the consumer selects for the
purchase.  Your membership is granted for the specific location of your store as stated in your Membership
Agreement (Nonbranded) and Ace Brand Agreement.  The relocation of your store or the establishment by
you of additional Ace store(s) requires our specific approval.  Our general policy is to grant as many
memberships in a given market area as we deem necessary in order for the area to be adequately served by
our program.
In Ace’s sole discretion, we may offer memberships whereby a member can receive the benefits of being a
member but cannot hold himself or herself out as an Ace store.  Under this arrangement, the person signs
only the Membership Agreement (Nonbranded) and is not granted a license to use the Ace marks. Such a
member can purchase and sell Ace merchandise, including Ace private label merchandise.  However, such
a member’s location is not a franchise, and the member cannot identify or promote his or her retail business
as an Ace store.
