ITEM 12
TERRITORY
Franchise Agreement
Under the Franchise Agreement, we grant you a license to operate a Sonic Restaurant at a
location that we accept.  If your lease expires or is terminated without your fault, or if the
Restaurant is destroyed, condemned, or otherwise rendered unusable, you may relocate the
Restaurant to a new site within the Protected Area (defined below) that is acceptable to us.  You
must pay all costs associated with the relocation and comply with the Franchise Agreement’s
provisions relating to the development and opening of the Restaurant at the new site and de-
identification of the old site.
Except as described below, we will not own or operate a Sonic Restaurant, and will not
franchise to any other person to own or operate a Sonic Restaurant (other than a Sonic Restaurant
franchised before the date of the Franchise Agreement), within the Restaurant’s Protected Area.
The “Protected Area” is defined on the Franchise Agreement’s effective date and is:
(a)
a radius extending 1.5 miles from the front door of the Restaurant if located
within a city, town, or MSA having a population of 75,000 or more;
(b)
a radius extending 2 miles from the front door of the Restaurant if located
within a city, town, or MSA having a population of less than 75,000 but more than 25,000;
(c)
a radius extending 3 miles from the front door of the Restaurant if located
within a city, town, or MSA having a population of 25,000 or less; or
(d)
a radius extending 3 miles from the front door of the Restaurant if located
outside a city, town, or MSA.

We determine the population of an MSA on and after the Franchise Agreement’s effective date
based on the latest published federal census (or other data we select) and may reduce the Protected
Area based on this data upon notice to you.  If more than one subpart (a) through (d) applies, then
the subpart with the smallest area is the Protected Area.
However, the Protected Area does not extend into the contractually-granted protected
radius of any Sonic Restaurant in existence on the Franchise Agreement’s effective date
(“Previously Protected Radius”), the protected area of any developer under a development
agreement with us in existence on the Franchise Agreement’s effective date (“Previously Protected
Development Area”), or any Non-Drive-In Location or Non-Traditional Location that is otherwise
located within the Protected Area.  Therefore, and despite your rights as described above, any
Previously Protected Radius, Previously Protected Development Area, Non-Drive-In Location and
Non-Traditional Location is excluded from the Protected Area, and we may own or operate a Sonic
Restaurant, and may franchise to any other person to own or operate a Sonic Restaurant, within
any Previously Protected Radius, Previously Protected Development Area, Non-Drive-In Location
or Non-Traditional Location, whether they would otherwise be located within or outside the
boundaries of the Protected Area.  Because of these limitations, you will not receive an exclusive
territory.  You may face competition from other franchisees, from outlets that we own, or from
other channels of distribution or competitive brands that we control.
If you operate your Restaurant at a Non-Traditional Location, then we and you will sign
the Non-Trad Rider.  Under the Non-Trad Rider you receive no Protected Area and no territorial
rights or protection.
Except as the Franchise Agreement expressly limits us, we retain all rights concerning the
Sonic system, the Proprietary Marks, the sale of similar or dissimilar products and services, and
any other activities we deem appropriate whenever and wherever we desire.  For example, we
specifically reserve the following rights:
(1)
the right to establish and operate, and to grant to others the right to establish
and operate, similar businesses or any other businesses offering similar or dissimilar
products and services through similar or dissimilar channels of distribution, at any locations
inside or outside the Protected Area under trademarks or service marks other than the
Proprietary Marks and on any terms we deem appropriate;
(2)
the right to provide, offer, and sell, and to grant others the right to provide,
offer, and sell, goods and services that are identical or similar to and/or competitive with
those provided at the Restaurant, whether identified by the Proprietary Marks or other
trademarks or service marks, through dissimilar distribution channels (including the
Internet or similar electronic media) both inside and outside the Protected Area and on any
terms we deem appropriate;
(3)
the right to establish and operate, and to grant to others the right to establish
and operate, businesses offering dissimilar products and services, both inside and outside
the Protected Area, under the Proprietary Marks and on any terms we deem appropriate;
Sonic | 2024 FDD
ACTIVE\1602249592.4
(4)
the right to establish and operate, and to grant others the right to establish
and operate, Sonic Restaurants anywhere outside the Protected Area under any terms we
deem appropriate regardless of the proximity to the Restaurant; and
(5)
the right to be acquired (regardless of the form of transaction) by a business
providing products and services similar to those provided at the Restaurant, or by another
business, even if that business operates, franchises, and/or licenses competitive businesses
in the Protected Area.
Subject to complying with our standards concerning delivery, there are no restrictions on
your soliciting or accepting orders from consumers outside of the Protected Area, but you do not
have the right to use other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales,
telemarketing, or other direct marketing, to make sales within or outside of your Protected Area.
We and our affiliates may use other channels of distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales,
telemarketing, or other direct marketing, to make sales within the Protected Area using the
Proprietary Marks or other trademarks without compensating you.  Continuation of your territorial
rights under the Franchise Agreement does not depend on your achieving a certain sales volume,
market penetration or other contingency.  The Franchise Agreement does not provide you options,
rights of first refusal, or similar rights to acquire additional franchises within the Protected Area
or contiguous areas.  We may alter your Protected Area and modify your territorial rights in the
Protected Area based on population changes as we describe above or if you relocate the Restaurant.
If we and any Other Franchisor grant you the right to operate a Sonic Restaurant and one
or more Other Restaurants at a Multi-Brand Location, Other Franchisor(s) may grant you territorial
exclusivity which will be described in Other Franchisor’s FDD and/or Other Franchise Agreement.
Development Agreement
If we and you sign a Development Agreement, then we grant to you the right (directly or
through Controlled Affiliates) to develop and sign Franchise Agreements to operate the number of
new Sonic Restaurants identified on the Development Schedule within the Development Area.
We typically determine the geographical boundaries of the Development Area and the
Development Schedule based on demographic evaluations, traffic patterns, residential and
commercial concentrations, physical geographic profiles, viable competition in the market area
and other factors.  We also consider your financial and management capabilities to properly
finance and manage multiple Sonic Restaurants.  There is no minimum size for Development
Areas.
To maintain your rights under the Development Agreement, you (or a Controlled Affiliate)
must sign Franchise Agreements with us for, and open and begin operating, the number of new
Sonic Restaurants described under the Development Schedule within the timeframes in the
Development Schedule.  If you fail to comply with any aspect of the Development Schedule, we
may terminate the Development Agreement.  Except for these situations, continuation of your
territorial rights in the Development Area does not depend on your achieving a certain sales
volume, market penetration or other contingency, and we may not alter your Development Area
or modify your territorial rights in the Development Area.  You have no options, rights of first
refusal or similar rights to acquire additional franchises.

Except as described below, during the term of the Development Agreement, if you are in
compliance with the Development Agreement (including the Development Schedule), and you and
your affiliates are in compliance with any other related agreements, then we will not own or operate
a Sonic Restaurant, and will not franchise to any other person to own or operate a Sonic Restaurant
(other than a Sonic Restaurant franchised before the date of the Development Agreement), within
the Development Area.  However, if the Development Area covers more than one city, county,
designated market area or target area (each “Target Area”), this territorial protection for each
Target Area expires upon the earlier of (x) the expiration or termination of the Development
Agreement, or (b) the date upon which you or your Controlled Affiliate signs a Sonic Franchise
Agreement for the final Sonic Restaurant to be developed in that Target Area.  When this territorial
protection expires for the Development Area or Target Area (as applicable), we may then own and
operate, and franchise to any other person to own and operate, a Sonic Restaurant in the
Development Area or Target Area (as applicable), except as otherwise provided under any Sonic
Franchise Agreement then in effect.
However, the Development Area does not extend into the contractually-granted protected
radius of any Sonic Restaurant in existence on the Development Agreement’s effective date
(“Previously Protected Radius”), the protected area of any developer under a development
agreement with Sonic in existence on the Development Agreement’s effective date (“Previously
Protected Development Area”), or any Non-Drive-In Location or Non-Traditional Location that is
otherwise located within the Protected Area.  Therefore, and despite your rights as described
above, any Previously Protected Radius, Previously Protected Development Area, Non-Drive-In
Location and Non-Traditional Location is excluded from the Development Area, and we may own
or operate a Sonic Restaurant, and may franchise to any other person to own or operate a Sonic
Restaurant, within any Previously Protected Radius, Previously Protected Development Area,
Non-Drive-In Location or Non-Traditional Location, whether they would otherwise be located
within or outside the boundaries of the Development Area.  Because of these limitations, you will
not receive an exclusive territory.  You may face competition from other franchisees, from outlets
that we own, or from other channels of distribution or competitive brands that we control.
Except as the Development Agreement expressly limits us, we retain all rights concerning
the Sonic system, the Proprietary Marks, the sale of similar or dissimilar products and services,
and any other activities we deem appropriate whenever and wherever we desire.  For example, we
specifically reserve the following rights:
(i)
the right to establish and operate, and to grant to others the right to establish
and operate, similar businesses or any other businesses offering similar or dissimilar
products and services through similar or dissimilar channels of distribution, at any locations
inside or outside the Development Area under trademarks or service marks other than the
Proprietary Marks and on any terms we deem appropriate;
(ii)
the right to provide, offer, and sell, and to grant others the right to provide,
offer, and sell, goods and services that are identical or similar to and/or competitive with
those provided at any Sonic Restaurant, whether identified by the Proprietary Marks or
other trademarks or service marks, through dissimilar distribution channels (including the
Sonic | 2024 FDD
ACTIVE\1602249592.4
Internet or similar electronic media) both inside and outside the Development Area and on
any terms we deem appropriate;
(iii)
the right to establish and operate, and to grant to others the right to establish
and operate, businesses offering dissimilar products and services, both inside and outside
the Development Area, under the Proprietary Marks and on any terms we deem
appropriate;
(iv)
the right to establish and operate, and to grant others the right to establish
and operate, Sonic Restaurants anywhere outside the Development Area under any terms
we deem appropriate regardless of the proximity to any of your Sonic Restaurants; and
(v)
the right to be acquired (regardless of the form of transaction) by a business
providing products and services similar to those provided at any Sonic Restaurant, or by
another business, even if such business operates, franchises, and/or licenses competitive
businesses in the Development Area.
Affiliated Programs
Except as described in Item 1, we do not operate or franchise, or currently plan to operate
or franchise, any business under a different trademark that sells or will sell goods or services
similar to those that our franchisees sell.  However, our affiliates, including the Affiliated Programs
described in Item 1 and other portfolio companies that currently are or in the future may be owned
by private equity funds managed by Roark Capital Management, LLC, may operate and/or
franchise businesses that sell similar goods or services to those that our franchisees sell.  Item 1
describes our current Affiliated Programs that offer franchises, their principal business addresses,
the goods and services they sell, whether their businesses are franchised and/or company-owned,
and their trademarks.  All of these other brands (with limited exceptions) maintain offices and
training facilities that are physically separate from the offices and training facilities of our franchise
network.  Most of the Affiliated Programs are not direct competitors of our franchise network
given the products or services they sell, although some are, as described in Item 1. All of the
businesses that our affiliates and their franchisees operate may solicit and accept orders from
customers near your business.  Because they are separate companies, we do not expect any
conflicts between our franchisees and our affiliates’ franchisees regarding territory, customers and
support, and we have no obligation to resolve any perceived conflicts that might arise.
