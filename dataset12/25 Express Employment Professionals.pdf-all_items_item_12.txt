ITEM 12
TERRITORY
Your Territory will be specified in the Franchise Agreement and will have a minimum
of 30,000 jobs based on results from GbBIS, a division of Intelligent Direct Inc.  A copy of the
GbBis report will be attached to Your Franchise Agreement with Us.
You must have an office in Your Territory.  You may relocate Your office so long as the
new location is within Your Territory.  In the event of relocation, Your Territory will remain
unchanged.
With the exception of Direct Hire Services and the potential reversion of the SRG
Services rights to Us, under the Franchise Agreement, You are granted an exclusive territory.
As a result of the potential reversion or termination of the SRG Services rights and/or other
franchisee’s Direct Hire Services, You could face competition from Us or other franchisees.
However, You are granted certain territorial protections as described in this Item.
As long as You perform Your duties under the Franchise Agreement, are not in default
under the Franchise Agreement, and have maintained Your offices as required, We will not
establish, except as otherwise described below, other third-party franchises or company-
owned outlets selling or leasing the same products or services under the same or different
trade name(s) or trademark(s) in Your Territory during the term of the Franchise Agreement.
Except as described below, We will refer all leads and inquiries for personnel services
that We receive from client business locations within Your Territory to You, whether through
Internet, telephone or otherwise. You must only send Associates to client business locations
within Your Territory.  You must not send Associates to a client business location in another
Franchisee’s granted territory even if the client is located within Your Territory.  If You violate
these restrictions, We may charge You a special fee, as specified in The Manual, as liquidated
damages.   All clients serviced by You will be Our clients and not Yours. With Our written
approval, You may send Associates to a client’s business location in a territory that has not
been granted to another Franchisee (an open territory).  Sending Associates to a client
business location in an open territory does not give You any rights to operate in the open
territory, except as specifically approved.  If You provide Associates to a client business
location in an open territory that is subsequently sold to an Express franchisee, You may
continue servicing that client for up to one year from the date in which the other franchisee
opens its Franchise in the formerly open territory, during which time You will introduce the
new Franchisee to the client.  At the end of one year You will (a) relinquish the client business
location to the other franchisee who acquired the open territory, (b) notify the client that
further requests for Associates should be directed to the new Franchisee and, (c) You will be
required to coordinate the transfer of the Associates at the client business location to the new
Franchisee in such a manner as to minimize the impact of the transfer on the client business
location.  Your failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a default under the
Franchise Agreement, and We will have the rights specified in the Franchise Agreement,
including the right to charge You a special fee, as specified in The Manual, as liquidated
damages.

Our written approval.  You may advertise using methods that are generally circulated or
broadcast throughout Your Territory and that extend beyond Your Territory, such as, but not
limited to magazine or newspaper advertisements, use of mail zones, or radio or television
broadcasts, so long as such advertisements or broadcasts are not specifically targeted to
primarily reach areas or clients outside of Your Territory.  You must not establish or operate
a business under the Proprietary Marks in a different or additional territory, unless We grant
You an additional Franchise, or We amend the Franchise Agreement.

(1)
To establish franchised or company-owned outlets, under the Proprietary Marks
or otherwise, outside Your Territory.
(2)

to enter into other arrangements with third parties in order to provide such
services.
(3)
To establish franchised or company-owned businesses, within the boundary line

using the Proprietary Marks or otherwise, that provides Temporary Staffing
Services and Direct Hire Services for Professionals only if You do not timely
exercise Your rights to the SRG Services within the SRG Option Period, or fail
to meet the SRG Services performance requirements set forth in the franchise
agreement, or otherwise notify Us in writing of Your waiver of Your right to
perform the SRG Services.
(4)
Within or outside Your Territory, to develop additional or different personnel
placement services, or to develop an application of personnel placement
services for particular categories of clients, and incorporate such services or

which are made applicable to those new services or applications at the time of
their introduction; or to develop a new franchise or license for such new service;
provided, however, that We will not offer to issue said franchise or license within
Your Territory unless We have previously offered it to You and You have
rejected it; or not accepted it within 90 days of Our offer.

participate in these programs, You will be required to charge such customers

We may periodically adjust and modify the Your Territory, as We reasonably determine to be
necessary or appropriate, in order to more properly or more accurately describe the
boundaries or area; correct inaccuracies or discrepancies in boundaries; conform the
boundaries to areas that We identified as within Your Territory at the time of signing Your
Franchise Agreement; or clarify, correct, or better describe the boundary line or area based
on physical, political, or topographical characteristics, including changes to those
characteristics
that
may
occur
at
any
time
after
You
execute
the
Franchise
Agreement.  Adjustments may result in a reduction of the area comprising Your Territory, but
Your Territory will have, following the adjustment, a minimum of 30,000 jobs.  Any
adjustment will be effective immediately when We give You written notice describing the
adjusted Territory.
You do not have the right to establish additional Franchises and You will not receive
any options, rights of first refusal, or similar rights to acquire additional Franchises.
Neither We, nor any of Our affiliates, operates, franchises, or has plans to operate or
franchise a business under a different trademark selling goods or services similar to those
You will offer. However, the Franchise Agreement does not prohibit Us from doing so.
Minimum Performance Standards
Your failure to meet the Minimum Performance Standards in subsections (a) or (b)
below for two or more consecutive quarters or as set forth in subsection (c) below for any two
or more calendar quarters in any 12-month period will, at Our option, constitute a default
under the Franchise Agreement, for which We can terminate the Franchise Agreement.  We
will notify You in writing of the occurrence of any event of default based on Your failure to
meet the Minimum Performance Standards, which are as follows:
a. Open more than 12 months but less than 24 months:  a combined total of Gross Margin
and Gross Receipts of at least $50,000 per fiscal quarter provided however, You must
have a minimum Gross Margin of $41,500.

In addition, once You have exercised Your right to perform the SRG Services, You must
be consistently averaging a minimum of $10,000 in Gross Margin weekly solely attributable
to Your SRG Services no later than 24 months following Your entry into the then-current SRG
Services training system.  If You do not maintain the minimum Gross Margin, We may
terminate all rights to the SRG Services portion of Your Franchise.  Thereafter, We will have
the right to perform or re-sell to a third party the SRG Services within Your Territory without
compensation to You.

achieving a certain sales volume, market penetration or other contingency, and, except as
described above, Your Territory may not be altered.
